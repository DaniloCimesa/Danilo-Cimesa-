# Hello There!
About me


- 👋 Hi, I’m @DaniloCimesa
- 👀 I’m Petroleum engineer by education with a recently found passion for coding and Data. I consider myself proficient with SQL, currently learning Python. :)
- 🌱 At the moment I'm a Database Administrator, but ultimate goal would be to become Data Analyst or Data Engineer, however we'll see about that.
- 💞️ Feel free to share everything and anything about SQL and Data.
